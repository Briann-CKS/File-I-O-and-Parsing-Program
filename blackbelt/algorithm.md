## Algorithm 
# About the Black Belt 
I did an improved version of the program that takes **zero integers addition or zero sum** into consideration while passing the strings to another file. When the program reads a sum that has a value of zero, it will not print the string. Instead, the program will pass a sentence to the file to tell the user that they have a zero sum for the string that they intend to pass/print. Also, I have modified the program so that when the program realizes that there is **no string in a particular set of integers and string**, it will pass a funny sentence to the file to tell the user that the string does not exist in that set. 

I also did a make file for this blackbelt assignment. I tried compiling and running the program, it ran and executed every command as intended successfully.
